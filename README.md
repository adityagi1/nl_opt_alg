The following repository contains files I wrote containing Java implementations of various nonlinear optimization algorithms.
The following Java source code files are included:
- SteepestDescentOptimizer.java: Java implementation of SteepestDescent Optimization Algorithm
- NewtonMethodOptimizer.java: Java implementation of Newton's Method Optimization Algorithm
- NewtonMethodApplication.java: Application of Newton's Method 

Some results visualization files are also included representing the outcome of running the above algorithms.
